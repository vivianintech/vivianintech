:cherry_blossom: Hi, I'm Vivian, a TypeScript enthusiast based in sunny Brisbane.<br /><br />

I have a genuine passion for software development, with a particular love for working on the back end of applications. TypeScript is my go-to language, as its expressive and type-safe nature brings joy to my coding journey.<br /><br />

But it's not all about code for me! When I'm not immersed in the world of software, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen. Believe it or not, I've discovered a newfound love for cooking!<br /><br />

Oh, and did I mention my adorable feline companion? Meet Noodle, my lovely cat. He keeps me company while I work, always finding a cozy spot on my desk. Having him around brings an extra dose of happiness to my coding session.<br /><br />

My coding adventure began in 2019, without a computer science degree. I embraced the challenge and completed the SheCodes coding bootcamp, equipping myself with practical skills and a solid foundation in web development.<br /><br />

Join me on this exciting journey as we dive into the world of TypeScript and create amazing software together!<br /><br />
